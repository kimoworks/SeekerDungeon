ChainDepth (working name) is your submission for the MONOLITH hackathon (the second Solana Mobile Hackathon, running from February 2 to March 9, 2026, with over $125K in prizes, including a dedicated SKR integration track). The game is built specifically for the Seeker phone, leveraging its Seed Vault Wallet, Mobile Wallet Adapter, and native SKR token as a core utility. With your 15+ years in Unity and SpriteCook for rapid pixel art asset creation, the focus is a lightweight, mobile-first experience that emphasizes a meaningful shared onchain world—where every player contributes to a single, evolving dungeon that everyone sees and feels in real time. The onchain component is minor but impactful (SKR stakes/tips/rewards for progression), keeping the Solana side simple so agentic AI can handle most of the program while you concentrate on fun gameplay, visuals, and polish.
Player Experience: What It Feels Like to Play ChainDepth
You open the game on your Seeker phone—the wallet connects seamlessly via Seed Vault (one-tap, no seed phrases). Your SKR balance appears (e.g., 8.7 SKR), and the screen fades into a cozy, retro pixel-art dungeon room: dim cave floor, static wall sprites at the edges, maybe a glowing treasure chest in the center, and a global depth meter at the top ("Depth 18 / ∞ – 142 miners active this season").
You're inside one room at a time—the view is focused and intimate, like peering into a single cave chamber. Your cute miner avatar (a simple static sprite you bob up and down with a gentle tween) stands in the middle. Scattered around are 2–8 other players' avatars (tiny colored dots or figures, tinted from their pubkeys, names floating above). Some are idle, some have pickaxes rotating idly as they work jobs. You immediately feel the shared vibe: this isn't your solo dungeon—it's the community's living, breathing space.

Explore & Move: Pan the edges to spot doors. Open arches show clear passages (empty arch sprite). Blocked ones glow with rubble (red-tinted static sprite). Tap an open door → your avatar smoothly tweens out, the screen fades, and you instantly load the adjacent room. You can wander freely through already-cleared paths, discovering deeper areas that early players unlocked. Late joiners start with many rooms already revealed, jumping straight into the action.
Join a Job: Tap a rubble wall (e.g., North edge) → popup: "Join 'Clear Rubble' – base 120 seconds, stake 0.01 SKR". Confirm (Seeker one-tap tx). Your avatar slides to the wall, pickaxe sprite starts rotating in a lazy loop. You see helpers listed ("You + Bob + Alice mining North – time left: 45s"). The more people join, the faster it goes (progress auto-divides time—3 helpers = ~40s effective).
Add Fun While Waiting: Tap a pulsing ore icon for a quick 30-second offchain mini-game (rhythm taps to "chip away"). High score → auto-send a tiny 0.001 SKR tip tx to boost progress 10–20%. Meanwhile, watch the shared progress bar fill (smooth scale tween), particles sparkle when someone boosts, and avatars bob excitedly. It's low-pressure—switch views, check inventory, or just admire the live collaboration.
Completion & Reveal: When progress hits 100% (anyone can trigger the final tx), rubble explodes in particles, the wall fades to an open door, and the global depth meter ticks up (+1). A small SKR reward splits among helpers (stake back + bonus from the prize pool). Fireworks animate across the screen. The new adjacent room unlocks for everyone—late players now see it too.
Loot Treasures: Some rooms have a static chest sprite in the center. Tap it → "Loot (tiny fee?)" tx. You get the same random loot as everyone else who hasn't claimed it yet (e.g., "Iron Ore x3" or "Gem Shard"). Items appear as cards in your inventory (simple UI panel with SpriteCook icons that tween/flip in). You can't loot twice—onchain prevents it.
Seasonal Loop & Purpose: The dungeon expands outward from the starting room (procedural layout, more walls/deeper rooms get exponentially harder—longer times, need bigger crowds). No hard "win"—instead, weekly seasons reset (new seed, depth back to 0) with leaderboards (top contributors get extra SKR from a community pool). You feel part of something bigger: every rubble cleared, every depth gained, advances the shared world that thousands of Seeker users are building together.

The experience is addictive yet bite-sized (5–15 minute sessions): wander, collaborate on jobs, loot satisfying treasures, watch the map grow because of your (and others') actions. SKR feels meaningful—small stakes create skin-in-the-game and fund rewards, without ever feeling punitive (refunds on success). It's cozy, social, and truly onchain: the dungeon only exists because players stake, boost, and complete together. Perfect for the hackathon's shared, SKR-native mobile focus.
